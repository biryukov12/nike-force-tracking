### Parsing Low/Mid/High Air Force 1 from nike.com by schedule and once.
footwear_size = 7.5 US;

Now i'm using a hard filter for myself, one request, less than 25 objects, yes async is unnecessary (using for future tasks).

TODO: add caching of past parsing results; add a selection of parameters for parsing where will be more than one request and 25 parsing objects.
